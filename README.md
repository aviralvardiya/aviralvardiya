I am a self-taught full-stack web developer skilled in modern frontend, backend, and deployment technologies.

On the frontend, I am proficient with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript as core foundations. I make use of React and Next.js to build dynamic web apps with popular state management tools like Recoil and Redux. I prefer Tailwind CSS to give apps a modern look. Additionally, I leverage React Router DOM for client-side routing, react-hooks-form for efficient form submissions, and Axios for making asynchronous requests.

Moving to the backend, I am well-versed in Node.js, Express.js and Hono. I have expertise in MongoDB and PostgreSQL and use Mongoose and Prisma as my preferred ODM/ORM. I can implement authentication in apps using Passport.js, JWT tokens, and NextAuth. I also use Zod for validating the data.

Furthermore, for deployment, I use Git and GitHub as version control, and Docker is my go-to tool for containerization. I have experience in deploying apps on remote servers using AWS EC2 (BE) and S3 (FE), as well as on Cloudflare Workers and Vercel for serverless deployment. I can use TurboRepo to maintain a project as a monorepo.

Along with this, I also use design tools like Figma and Canva. I am adept at project management, team leading, and public speaking. Currently, I work as a mechanical maintenance manager and am actively looking for opportunities in the field of web development.
